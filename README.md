# DecisionJungle
Machine Learning.
Decision Jungle implementation in WEKA. Bagging Ensemble of Decision Directed Acyclic Graphs.
The DecisionJungle class in weka.classifiers.trees creates a Decision Jungle ensemble classifier which combines Bagging and Random Feature selection. Comparable to the Random Forest but contains lesser number of nodes in the model, which is helpful in memory-constrained devices.
